# Processing Equivalence Relations
## TAOCP
I did this project based upon Algorithm E from Donald Knuth's wonderful work The Art of Computer Programming. Specifically, it is from section 2.3.3; it made a good project I could write in Go, a language I have been meaning to write more of.
I tried to keep my code true to his literature, using j and k in the same way and such.
## To do
* Try to make use of concurrency using channels and possible a mutex (is this possible??)
